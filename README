CityMatch is a web application for searching and filtering urban cultural events using automatically collected data from public sources.
The project focuses on building a complete data pipeline, from automated event collection to a user-facing web interface.

Live demo : https://citymatch.onrender.com/

Features
CityMatch allows users to explore cultural events across multiple European cities by filtering events according to personal interests, location, date, and free-text keywords.
The application automatically collects, normalizes, and updates event data and presents results through an interactive web interface.

Data collection

Global events such as concerts and major shows were initially collected using the Ticketmaster API.
Local events including exhibitions, markets, and festivals are updated regularly using SerpApi and Google Events.

Data updates are automated through a GitHub Actions workflow running every three days.

Event data is automatically updated using GitHub Actions.
API keys are securely stored using GitHub Secrets.

This project was developed in an academic context and focuses on data collection, processing, and application design rather than large-scale deployment.
